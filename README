NOTE: 
This project is older (from the Python 2 days). This project started out in R, and transitioned into a Python project--integrating R and Python with rpy2. The 
data for this project is not mine so, I cannot disclose the data used. See more in PDF--a poster presented at the Mary Gates Research Symposium.

DESCRIPTION:
This is the project directory for a machine learning project using fractional anisotropy mean and neuropsychological data (on depression and executive functioning) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.  

INSTRUCTIONS:
1) In R, set working directory with path to ADNIMachineLearning.

DIRECTORY MAP:

TODO: 

1) place old data/results/scripts into project directory
2) create data cleaning/checking system for executive functioning data
